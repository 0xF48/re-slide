`Slide` can generally be used as a wrapper for any ui element that requires some sort of "reveal", a quick and easy example is a simple button with underlines and transitions. by setting `pos:0.1` we can offset the slide by some percentage relative to the floored value. click and hover over each button to see the effect. Think of any other way you can use this? 
> hint: progress bars, input fields, toggle buttons...etc
