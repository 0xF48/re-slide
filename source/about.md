With increasing modern UI complexity, its easy to get lost in complex solutions and css hacks. Use this universal component to layout your app and slide between different ui components and modules. Parts of the UI that are not visible in the viewport are automatically not rendered because parts that you dont need are not in the viewport until you slide them in!
