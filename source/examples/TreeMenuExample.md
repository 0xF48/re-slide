This example is a bit more advanced and really pushes the limits of what you can practically do. This example shows how you can actually "hack" the ui with the `Slide`, creating components that would otherwise be impossible or would have taken thousands of lines of code. Check out the example source code and see if you can grasp how I used the nested slide offset trick to create a smooth and optimized tree menu from a single list state object in just 150 lines of code.

Notice how the div count changes dynamically. This is automatically done by `Slide` so you dont have to worry about rendering components that are not visible. However, even though the components dont get rendered, the props are still passed down. If you want to avoid passing down to many props inside render you can always store your components in variables.
